## Welcome to the IVOA newcomer session!

We are happy that you join in to our introduction to the IVOA. In the
following two sessions we want to five you an overview about the VO
standards, how they are connected, and how they are connected to the
Working Groups. We hope this will make it easier to get into the work
flow of the Interop meeting.

### Session 1 
will introduce to some of the VO standards following a
multimessenger use case

### Session 2 
will see the implementation of these standards in PyVO and how automatic
access to data and between client software works. Also, we will show a
model of the way a standard goes from being a demand to become a
recommendation. 

The full material of the sessions is available in the github repository
linked to this page here. You can access it by following the above link
under the main header of this page. 
The main steps will be covered by this
